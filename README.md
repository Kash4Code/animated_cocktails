## ‚ú® Overview 

Welcome to the Animated Cocktails project! This is a visually rich, scroll-driven website I've built to explore and demonstrate advanced web animations using React and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). It's designed to provide a smooth and engaging user experience, bringing a cocktail showcase to life with dynamic interactions and responsive design.

This project focuses on leveraging modern frontend technologies to create a high-performance, animated interface


<a name="tech-stack"></a>
## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

* **GSAP:** The GreenSock Animation Platform is a robust JavaScript library I used to craft dynamic, scroll-driven visuals. It enables features like SplitText animations for engaging text reveals, ScrollTrigger for precise timeline control, smooth parallax scrolling, pinned sections, and custom animated carousels.

* **React:** I've utilized React to build a declarative and component-based user interface. This approach allows for modular development, seamless integration of complex GSAP animations, efficient state management, and ensures a responsive layout adaptable to various screen sizes.

* **Tailwind CSS:** For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework. It allowed me to rapidly design and implement custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly within the components, streamlining the styling workflow.

* **Vite:** The development workflow for this project is powered by Vite, a next-generation frontend tool. It provides a lightning-fast build process, instant hot module replacement, and optimized production builds, which is ideal for an animation-heavy React application requiring real-time development feedback.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **SplitText Animations:** Dynamic and impactful text reveals using GSAP's SplitText for engaging introductions and section highlights.
* **ScrollTrigger Effects:** Advanced scroll-based animations and precise timeline control powered by GSAP's ScrollTrigger.
* **Parallax Scrolling:** Immersive depth added through smooth parallax effects that respond fluidly to user scroll actions.
* **Pinned Sections:** Sections can be "pinned" in view while animating their internal content, creating compelling scroll experiences.
* **Scroll-Synced Video Playback:** Video progress is synchronized with scroll position for cinematic and interactive storytelling.
* **Image Masking Effects:** Visually striking image transitions achieved with scroll-triggered pins and masking techniques.
* **Custom Carousel:** A fully customized, animated carousel with multiple navigation options and smooth slide transitions.
* **Seamless Timeline Animations:** Artfully crafted animation timelines that flow smoothly across different sections of the website.
* **Responsive Design:** A fluid and adaptive UI, ensuring all GSAP animations and layouts perform beautifully across all screen sizes.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

I have several features planned to scale this project and enhance its functionality. The goal is to evolve this from a showcase into a fully interactive web application.

* **API Integration:** Transition from static data to a dynamic backend by integrating a public API like [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to fetch a vast library of cocktail recipes.
* **Search & Filtering:** Implement a robust search functionality allowing users to find cocktails by name. Add filters to sort drinks by ingredients, alcoholic/non-alcoholic content, or glass type.
* **Recipe Detail View:** Create a modal or a dedicated page for each cocktail that displays detailed information, including a list of ingredients, measurements, and step-by-step preparation instructions.
* **User Accounts & Favorites:** Introduce user authentication (e.g., via Firebase or Supabase) to allow users to create accounts, log in, and save their favorite cocktails to a personal collection.
* **Ingredient-Based Suggestions:** Add a "What's in your bar?" feature where users can select ingredients they own, and the application will suggest cocktails they can make.

## üôè Acknowledgements
                                
This project was developed based on a tutorial and foundational concepts provided by Adrian Hajdin and the [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@JavaScriptMastery) YouTube channel. Their excellent resources were invaluable in helping me learn and implement these advanced animation techniques.
